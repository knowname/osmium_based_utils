A collection of Osmium-based utilities for doing things
with OSM data files. 

Note:

These tools are based on the old version of Osmium, not the new one found in the osmcode/libosmium repo.
The osmcode/osmtool repo has a command line utility that can be used to replace some of these programs:

* As a lastnode.cpp replacement, use `osmium fileinfo x.osm.pbf -eg data.maxid.nodes
